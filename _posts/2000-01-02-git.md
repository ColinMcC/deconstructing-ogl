# **introduction to git & github**

#### Patrick J. Burns (ISAW-NYU)

Git is version control software, or software that enables you to track the history of changes to your files as you work over time. The first benefit of working with git is that it allows you return your code to previous states. The second, and much more important benefit, is that git allows you work on and keep track of changes in isolated parts of your code without disrupting the integrity of the whole (stable and working!) project. When edits are finished (and themselves stable and working), they can then be merged into the larger project. And this is not only true of your version of a projectâ€”changes made by anybody working on a git project can be merged. In this way, git allows for many contributors to work on the same project, in a decentralized and asynchronous manner.

GitHub is a repository hosting service which uses git to manage file changes within each repository. GitHub has become one of the most popular code and data repositories for open-source development and many of the Digital Classics projects you are familiar with are stored there, including [Open Greek & Latin](https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin). Accordingly, an understanding of how to use GitHub functions like something of a passport to the world of Digital Classics.

In this module, participants will:

- Set up an account on GitHub
- **Fork** an existing GitHub repo to their own account
- **Clone** this repo to their laptop

## download, install & register
*NB: This module will cover a basic git workflow using both the GitHub Desktop application and using git with GitHub from the command line. Participants are welcome to use whichever platform they prefer. Participants new to git with no command line experience may find the application more user friendly.*

- **Register** for an account on GitHub: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
- **Download** the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/)
- **Download** the UVA Open Greek and Latin Project Guidelines [[PDF]](assets/OGLP Documentation_Dec2017.pdf) by Lucie Wall Stylianopoulos, Ann Burns, and Katelin Mikos (University of Virginia)
